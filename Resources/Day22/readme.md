### Authentication: Verifying Who You Are

Imagine your cluster is a fortress.  Authentication is like checking IDs at the gate.  Kubeconfig is your keycard containing certificates that identify you to the Kubernetes API server.

### Making API Calls:

To run a command against a cluster, you can use the below command
```
kubectl get pods --kubeconfig config
```

Normally, kubectl uses your local `$HOME/.kube/config` file for authentication so you dont have to pass the --kubeconfig parameter in every command. You can use below command
```
kubectl get pods
```

The below command shows an API call using raw arguments:

```
kubectl get --raw /api/v1/namespaces/default/pods \
  --server https://localhost:64418 \
  --client-key adam.key \
  --client-certificate adam.crt \
  --certificate-authority ca.crt
```

### Authorization: What You Can Do

Authorization is like granting access levels within the fortress. Kubernetes offers different methods:

- Node Authorizer: Ensures kubelets on nodes are authorized to communicate with the API server.
- ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control): Associates users with permissions but can be complex to manage.
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): The recommended approach! You create roles (like "dev") and assign users or groups to those roles.
- Webhooks (Optional): Leverage external tools like OPA for more complex authorization logic.

### Authorization Modes:

The API server can be configured with different authorization modes (like "always allow" or "always deny"), but these are for testing only.  In practice, a priority sequence is used as below:-

- Node Authorizer: Checks node communication.
- RBAC: Grants access based on assigned roles.
- Webhook (if enabled): Performs additional authorization checks.

### Remember:

- Authentication verifies your identity.
- Authorization determines your access level.
- RBAC is a user-friendly and recommended way to manage authorization.
