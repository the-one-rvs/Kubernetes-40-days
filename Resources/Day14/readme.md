# Taints and Tolerations in Kubernetes ðŸš§ðŸ“œ

In this guide, we'll explore taints and tolerations in Kubernetes, essential tools for managing where pods can be scheduled in your cluster.

---

## Taints: Putting Up Fences ðŸš«

Think of taints as "only you are allowed" signs on your Kubernetes nodes. A taint marks a node with a specific characteristic, such as `"gpu=true"`. By default, pods cannot be scheduled on tainted nodes unless they have a special permission called toleration. When a toleration on a pod matches with the taint on the node then only that pod will be scheduled on that node.

---

## Tolerations: Permission Slips for Pods âœ…

Toleration allows a pod to say, "Hey, I can handle that taint. Schedule me anyway!" You define tolerations in the pod specification to let them bypass the taints.

---

## Taints & Tolerations in Action ðŸŽ¬

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the commands to manage taints and tolerations:

### Tainting a Node:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=gpu:NoSchedule
```

This command taints node1 with the key "gpu" and the effect "NoSchedule." Pods without a toleration for this taint won't be scheduled there.

To remove the taint , you add - at the end of the command , like below.

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=gpu:NoSchedule-
```

### Adding toleration to the pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: redis
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - image: redis
    name: redis
  tolerations:
  - key: "gpu"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

>Note: This pod specification defines a toleration for the "gpu" taint with the effect "NoSchedule." This allows the pod to be scheduled on tainted nodes.

### Labels vs Taints/Tolerations

Labels group nodes based on size, type,env, etc. Unlike taints, labels don't directly affect scheduling but are useful for organizing resources.

### Limitations to Remember ðŸš§

Taints and tolerations are powerful tools, but they have limitations. They cannot handle complex expressions like "AND" or "OR." 
So, what do we use in that case? We use a combination of Taints, tolerance, and Node affinity, which we will discuss in the next video.
