### Task details

#### Checking Default User Permissions
Note: I am referring the username as `krishna` here in this task but feel free to use your own name or `adam` as per the previous task.
1. Change to the context to `krishna` that you created in the previous day 22 task.
2. Create a new Pod. What would you expect to happen?

#### Granting Access to the User
